// CPU74 isa functional tests
//
// Designed to test the CPU74 isa opcodes on an simulator or
// emulator with access to instruction memory addresses.
// Must be compiled with the LLVM based CPU74 compiler.
// The code will stop with a 'halt' instruction in case of
// failure. Check the immediatelly preceding code for the
// instructions to be checked.
//
// Set 'log' to 1 for text logging using the 'printstr' function
// NOTE that the log feature may use instructions
// that may not be tested and thus produce unpredictable results,
// unless at least the basic set of tests is passed
#define log 1

// Special 'halt' instruction test behaves opposite than the
// other tests. This should nornally be disabled
#define testHalt 0
